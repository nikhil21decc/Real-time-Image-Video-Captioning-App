1. Built a cross platform mobile app that records video of surroundings
via in-app Camera and shows real-time description of video as text
captions.
2. Majorly worked with Flutter(dart) for UI and used Red Hat
OpenShift API for predicting the output on the basis of given
real-time image frame as input.
3. CNN-RNN Model Architecture is used and accuracy of prediction is
around 79%.
